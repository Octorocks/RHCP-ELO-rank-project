# Ranked Songs Selection & ELO Rating System

## Overview
This project allows users to compare songs and update their ELO ratings based on selections. 
Every selection increments a persistent counter stored in `selectionCount.txt`. The system uses a linked list to manage song rankings and sorts them after every vote.

## File Structure
- **`main.js`** â€“ The Express.js backend server.
- **`userComparison.html`** â€“ Super simple html file for allowing users to compare tracks. 
- **`app.js`** â€“ The frontend script handling song selection.
- **`rankedSongs.json`** â€“ contains all RHCP songs, and their current rank as of upload.
- **`selectionCount.txt`** â€“ Tracks the number of selections made.
- **`linkedListFunctions.js`** â€“ Source file for most of the necessary functions.
- **`eloRatings.js`** â€“ Handles the logic of changing the ELO score, like in chess.

## Setup Instructions


## Persistence
- **`rankedSongs.json`** retains song rankings between sessions.
- **`selectionCount.txt`** ensures selection counts persist across restarts.

## Future Improvements
- Display selection count on the frontend.
- Implement additional ranking metrics.
- Add support for multiple users.

### Notes
This project uses a simple text file to track selections instead of a database for lightweight persistence. If scaling is needed, consider moving to SQLite or MongoDB.

ðŸš€ Happy ranking!
